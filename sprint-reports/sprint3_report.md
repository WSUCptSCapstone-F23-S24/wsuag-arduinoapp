# Sprint 3 Report 12/5/2023

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Plot Segmentation Model: We implemented a model for plot segmentation, allowing us to divide up the images by plot.


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 3, our team made significant progress towards completing the WSUAG Data Project. We added the new plot segmentation model, which was created using mask-rcnn. We trained the model, and developed a code to pipe images into it as well as to pipe images out of it with the plots segmented.

## Unfinished Work
We did not have any unfinished work in this sprint.
