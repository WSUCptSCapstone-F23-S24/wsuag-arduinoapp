# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Feature 1: Model Training: During Sprint 1, we completed the training of our machine learning model using a labeled dataset of 110 images. This trained model can now identify reference plates in images with a high degree of accuracy and annotate them with bounding boxes.
 * Script Development: We developed Python scripts to automate the data processing workflow.
 * Feature 3: Model Testing and Validation: Our team conducted rigorous testing and validation of the trained model. We used various test images to confirm its ability to accurately identify reference plates and apply precise annotations.
 * Command-Line Interface (CLI): We established a command-line interface for users to interact with the system. This CLI enables users to initiate data processing, stop the processing, and configure system settings through commands in the terminal.


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In Sprint 1, our team was dedicated to laying the foundation for the project. We began by diligently collecting a dataset of 110 images, ensuring diversity and relevance. Model training was a complex but rewarding task, involving extensive fine-tuning and adjustments to achieve high recognition accuracy. Script development was a pivotal move, as it introduced automation to our data processing workflow. This not only improved efficiency but also paved the way for future development. Model testing and validation were a critical step to ensure the model's readiness for advanced tasks. The establishment of a command-line interface and configuration file editing enhances user interaction and system customization, marking a successful sprint.

## Unfinished Work

While we achieved several milestones in Sprint 1, some tasks remain incomplete:

Remaking the Model (Training): We had intended to revisit and potentially remake the model through further training and refinements. However, this task could not be completed in this sprint.
Research Migration to Azure: We had planned to explore the migration of our project to the Azure cloud platform for potential benefits. This task has been deferred to a future sprint.
Figure Out Handling Images for Multiple Plates: We also had ongoing discussions on how to manage images containing multiple plates. This is a complex issue that we are yet to fully resolve.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
 * Model Remaking Clarity: We need to improve communication and clarity regarding the process of remaking the model. Better documentation and coordination are essential.
 * Azure Migration Research: Our research on migrating to Azure could be more thorough and structured. We plan to dedicate more time and effort to this in the next sprint.
 * Handling Multiple Plates: Handling images with multiple plates remains a complex challenge. We need to devise a clearer strategy for this scenario.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
 * Enhanced Model Training: We will establish a clearer process for model remaking and set specific goals for improvement.
 * In-Depth Azure Exploration: In the next sprint, we aim to delve deeper into the Azure migration possibilities, potentially creating a detailed plan for execution.
 * Resolution for Multiple Plates: We will focus on addressing the issue of handling images with multiple plates, seeking a practical and efficient solution.
