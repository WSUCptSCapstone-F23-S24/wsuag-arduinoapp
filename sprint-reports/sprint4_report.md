# Sprint 4 Report 2/2/2024

## What's New (User Facing)
 * New Framework for models
 * New Plot Segmentation Model
 * New Oriented Bounding Box Model


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 4, our team focused on upgrading the WSUAG Data Project by migrating to a new plot segmentation model. The migration involved implementing a yolov8 plot segmentation model, training it, and integrating it into our codebase. We have developed functionality to input images into the model and retrieve segmented plots.

## Unfinished Work
We did not have any unfinished work in this sprint.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
   * Successful migration to the new plot segmentation model.
   * All planned tasks were completed within the sprint timeframe.
   * Accomplished extra modifications to enhance project features.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Organizational aspects of the repository.
   * Better integration of subsystems.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Implement thorough testing to ensure all code functions as expected.
