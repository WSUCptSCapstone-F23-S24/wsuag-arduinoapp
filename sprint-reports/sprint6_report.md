# Sprint 6 Report 4/2/2024

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Updated Model: Deployed a new iteration of our model that improves accuracy and efficiency.
 * Enhanced Error Handling: Implemented more robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smoother user experiences.
 * Accuracy Testing Tools: Introduced new tools for performing accuracy tests to validate model outputs against benchmark data.


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our focus was on refining the core functionalities of the WSUAG Data Project by addressing key areas of model performance and data integrity. Significant improvements were made in error handling, enabling our application to manage unexpected situations more gracefully. We also developed and implemented code for rigorous accuracy tests, comparing our data outputs with established benchmarks to ensure our model's precision. These enhancements not only bolster the reliability of our project but also pave the way for more sophisticated data analysis in future developments.
